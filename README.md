# :rocket: react-typescript-webpack

This is a project template for [React](https://reactjs.org/) apps. It lives at https://sprout2000.github.io/react-typescript-webpack.

To create a new project based on this template using [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit):

```bash
npx degit sprout2000/react-typescript-webpack myapp
cd myapp
```

*Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.*


## :beers: Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd myapp
npm install
```

...then start webpack:

```bash
npm start
```

Navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and the page should reload with your changes.
